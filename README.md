# AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp

Hello all, in this project I am learning and redefining my aws cloud knowledge along with other technologies like Docker, Rollbar (for better error detection), HoneyComb (observability), etc. I am creating a web app called Cruddur that is essientially a Twitter (X) clone, but the catch is that you can set a timer on your posts so that they automatically delete after a certain time limit. I'm using modern languages (js, python, sql), libraries (react, flask), and system design strategies (microservices) to ensure accessibility and uptime. 

- Application: Cruddur
- Cohort: 2024-A1
